Our main goal is achieving Cutting Edge each tier while maintaining a light weekly raiding schedule. To be able to accomplish this requires all raiding members to come on time, prepared, and focused each week. Though this doesn’t mean that we don’t have fun and joke around and troll each other.

We expect raiders to be knowledgeable of fight encounters and familiar with strategies before zoning into raid. Strategy posts are up in advance to allow raiders time to review them. Collaboration and suggestions are always welcome and encouraged.

Ideally, everyone thinks of the guild as a team and puts the team’s success before themselves. In relation to this, loot is distributed under loot council based system that best serves the guild and rewards reliable, performing players. Our focus is to kill bosses. Loot makes that easier, but drama surrounding it will not be tolerated during raid time. As well, this may require you to sit out on a progress fight encounter if your class/spec is not well suited for the encounter, or if you are not performing well on that particular day.

We have an active roster with events outside raiding hours. Random heroic and normal raids, weekly keys, and more. We have number of high mythic+ key pushers always looking for others to beat the clock with. Also, we play games together outside of WoW. There are plenty of places for new personalities to shine.
