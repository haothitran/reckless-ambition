If you are looking to join Reckless Ambition on Area-52 (US) be sure to read our expectations from raiders before submitting your application:

- 90%+ raid attendance during progression.
- Continuing research to improve your performance in raid.
- Have a working microphone and willingness to use it.
- Have the following addons: Exorsus Raid Tools, Angry Assignments, Weak Auras, RC_LootCouncil, and some type of boss mod for fight encounters.

### Missing Raid

If you cannot make raid, you can post out in advance in our guild Discord under the #raid_attendance text channel. We do understand and sympathize when unforeseen events make it difficult to make raid. Life happens sometimes. However, we would appreciate it if you let us know, or else we will assume that you loved us and left us.

## Application

Fill out the following template and post it in our Discord [#application](/) text channel.

Once you have posted your application, it will be visible to officers for review. An officer will get back to you to either decline or to set up an interview. This process could take anywhere from a few hours to a couple days depending on how busy we are, so please be patient.

Contact for any questions or problems:
