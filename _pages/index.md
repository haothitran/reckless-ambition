Reckless Ambition of Area-52 (US) has a very unique raid schedule of weekend mornings of Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm EST. We have successfully been progressive raiding in this time slot since Throne of Thunder (+7 years!) and competing with other guilds on a far lighter raid schedule.
